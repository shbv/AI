# How to run? 
python GameManager_3.py

# Rules:
Each move can be up, down, left, right 
All the tiles in the grid move except when they are obstructed by non-zero tile that cannot move as well
Adjacent tiles merge if they are equal 
Player needs to make the move within 0.2 seconds after computer move to generate grid value
Make maximum score before grid is filled

# Algorithm:
Minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning is used
Several heuristics are used to estimate the utility of a state 
(since exploring till leaf node of search tree is not plausible within time constraint)
